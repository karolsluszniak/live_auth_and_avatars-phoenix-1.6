# Phoenix 1.6 example app with live auth and avatars

Sponsored by [Hawku](https://hawku.com).

## Features

This repo includes a sample Phoenix app that may be useful to kickstart an own project with a foundation for a web app driven by live views thanks to following features:

  * Application generated by [`mix phx.new`](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/Mix.Tasks.Phx.New.html)
  * Preconfigured [ex_check](https://hexdocs.pm/ex_check) making all code checks & tests runnable via `mix check`
  * Preconfigured [phoenix_live_controller](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix_live_controller) enabling live controllers with consistent auth
  * Accounts management generated by [`mix phx.gen.auth`](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/mix_phx_gen_auth.html)
  * Home, login, registration and profile settings converted to live views navigated w/o redirects
  * Profile settings extended with validated Twitter handle field
  * Profile settings extended with avatar upload powered by live view, [waffle](https://hexdocs.pm/waffle) and S3
  * All controller tests converted to live view tests

Follow the commit history to see how each was implemented.

## Usage

To start the server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

To start with S3 uploads enabled:

  * Authorize with `export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=x AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=y AWS_S3_BUCKET=z`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
